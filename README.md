## ðŸ“ˆ Yield Curve Construction and Interest Rate Modeling

This project demonstrates how to construct yield curves and model interest rates using unsupervised learning techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

### Contents

- `DownloadedData.csv`: Contains downloaded yield curve data for analysis.
- `YieldCurveConstruction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with detailed code and explanation of the entire modeling process.

### Key Concepts

- **Dimensionality reduction** with PCA
- **Yield curve visualization** and analysis
- **Interest rate factor modeling**

### Libraries Used

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Quandl
